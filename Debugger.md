`What are your favourite debugging tools and why?`

a) I use chrome web browser since it is one of the popular browsers used across hence Chrome Developer Tools is a quick way and my preferred debugging tool to debug the Javascript code.
b) I also use Visual Studio Code as my choice of open source editor which also has built-in Javascript debugging functionality.
c) Apart from the above mentioned tools, console.log and application logs could also be used for simple debugging.
